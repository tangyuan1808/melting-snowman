# Snowman

Snowman is a terminal game that mirrors the game play of hangman, though instead of hanging a man, you will be melting a snowman.

## The basics

Classic hangman is a guessing game where a word or phrase is given with each of the letters represented by a blank, and a player must guess the word of phrase before they run out of chances. The player can guess in single letters or guess the entire word, however if a letter or word is guessed incorrectly, then a penalty is given to the player. Classic hangman allows for five incorrect guesses before the player loses on the sixth guess.
